Problem 1: I have a text document and want to know "What are the three most
  common words in the text?"
    Extension: Let's exclude the following: [I, you, he, she it, we, they a, an]

  Step 1=> #simple Big picture goal immediately includes splitting the words and
    indexing them as soon as the input is chomped, so we can then sort the words
    and proceed with the process of excluding our array of #excluded_words,
    and return an output of the remaining words in their occurring order of use
    in the text.
  Step 2=> The interface should be a simple indexing of an input from the user,
    storage and be able to return a simple output to the user when queried for
    the list of words.
  Step 3=> small picture goal would be to create a simple output that represents
    the possibilities of including a column for how many times each word occurs
    to then simplify the output to the user.  In turn making it easier for the
    user to retain the information.
  Step 4=>
