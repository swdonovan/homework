#ADDITIONAL EXERCISES

#Problem 1: I have a text document and want to know "What are the three most
#  common words in the text?"
#    Extension: Let's exclude the following: [I, you, he, she it, we, they a, an]

  Step 1=> #simple Big picture goal immediately includes splitting the words and
    indexing them as soon as the input is chomped, so we can then sort the words
    and proceed with the process of removing the #excluded_words out of our array.

  Step 2=> The interface should be a simple indexing of an input from the user,
    storage and be able to return a simple output to the user when queried for
    the list of words.
  Step 3=> small picture goal would be to create a simple output that represents
    the possibilities of including a column for how many times each word occurs
    to then simplify the output to the user.  In turn making it easier for the
    user to retain the information.
  Step 4=> Achieving this goal will require the construction of another array,
    or the reconstruction of the previous indexed array to then quantify those
    repeated words.

  Step 5=> aprob.rb (insert link when able)

  Step 3=> The reconstruction will impose the problem that we possibly might
    lose the ability to output the words in occurring order....or the user may
    request the output be in numeric order &/or occurrence order.
  Step 4 => With that in mind that may require the another quick reconstruction
    of the indexed array to include the ability to sort either way with an
    if/else conditional, dependent on the user requested input.(Possible whole
    other bag of worms)
